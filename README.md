# Classification-suite-and-Methods-for-Performance-Evaluation
Predictive problems requires three main challenges to overcome. First, choosing the right classification algorithm. Second, building a robust building and testing environment for algorithm to learn and thirdly,  picking the appropriate performance metric for evaluation. Here it is explained how these challenges can be addressed.
